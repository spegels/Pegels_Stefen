Lesson_04
Functions=Organize programs into smaller blocks of code with more specialized tasks
Creating a function=defining a function
	def functionName()
	# function components are tabbed in
Parameters
-Allow performing of same function over and over again with different input data
	def functionName(<parameters>):
	#statement1
	#statement2,etc...
Calling a Function
-Call a function by its name, a set of parentheses, and any data we are adding in as
parameters

Using Functions
-use "def" to start a function, followed by a name, a set of parentheses, and a colon
-put text inside parentheses, and BELOW the function, define the variables in the 
function itself
-define variables a second, third, etc time to create different outputs from the same
function.


Variable Scope(4.2)
scope of a variable=areas of the program where the variable is usable(callable)
-which statements/functions are able to use the variable
-If declaring a function, code statements for that function must be indented underneath
EX: def method1():
	var2=47
    def method2():
	var3=89.1
-method2 is out of the scope of var2
Global Variables
-Declared at top of a program, and therefeore can be used anywhere within it(no scope)
-Declared before any functions; no indents

Multiple Functions
-Use to prevent repetitive print statements
