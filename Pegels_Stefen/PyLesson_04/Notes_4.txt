Functions=Organize programs into smaller blocks of code with more specialized tasks
Creating a function=defining a function
	def functionName()
	# function components are tabbed in
Parameters
-Allow performing of same function over and over again with different input data
	def functionName(<parameters>):
	#statement1
	#statement2,etc...
Calling a Function
-Call a function by its name, a set of parentheses, and any data we are adding in as
parameters

Using Functions
-use "def" to start a function, followed by a name, a set of parentheses, and a colon
-put text inside parentheses, and BELOW the function, define the variables in the 
function itself
-define variables a second, third, etc time to create different outputs from the same
function.
