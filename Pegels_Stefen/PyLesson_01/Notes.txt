Programming Lesson 1 Notes

Stefen Pegels Period 3 Robinette

Compiler:Translates all code before running program- slower to load, but ensures program will run correctly
beforehand

Interpreter: Translates code while program is being run-increased risk of failure, but faster

Python: Contains a mixture of both a compiler and an interpreter

Bytecode: Intermediate between source code and processor

Python: Takes compiled data and turns it into bytecode, and the interpreter runs the bytecode to run the
program

Creating a Python doc: "New text doc", rename with .py

Process: print("STATEMENT")->Run(F5), save source code

"\" separates characters that have a separate meaning when side by side (ex: "")

ASCII art: Art made with printed code using characters
