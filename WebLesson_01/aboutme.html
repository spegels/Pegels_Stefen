	<h2><a name = "basic"></a>Basic Structure</h2>
	<p> HTML is a programming language used to create webpages. For HTML, the browser is the compiler that runs the text file.<br>
		HTML code includes text, links, and images outlined with tags. Tags, using <>, have an opening and closing, and format <br>
		the code with line breaks, new paragraphs, and headers.</p>
	<p> In order to move the code down to a new line, "< br>" or "< p>" are some tags that will move text down a new line, since <br>
		HTML does not recognize tabs in the text file. All text and tags to be seen by the user is included in the "< body>" of the <br>
		text file. the "< head>", which comes before the body, includes hidden information that will not show up on the webpage.</p>
	<p> To change the size and font of text, the "< strong>" tag boldens text, the "< em>" tag italicizes text, and "< h1>" and other header sizes <br>
		from 1-6 will create headers.

	<h2><a name = "link">Links and Page Navigation</a></h2>
	<p> In order to add a link to an HTML document, the anchor tag must be used "< a>". Links are used whenever a website wants to allow <br>
		a user to access another page. To add a link, start the anchor, add "href" with the desired web address in quotes.</p>
	<p> To add a page navigation, name a certain body of text by putting "name = ____" within your anchor, and then adding an href anchor statement <br>
		at the top of the page with a "#" before the name assigned below. This will allow the user to click on the navigation link and be directed <br>
		to the specified section of the HTML page.</p>
		
	<h2><a name = "image">Adding Images</a></h2>
	<p> To add an image to an HTML page, download the specified .jpg or .jpeg file, drag it into your HTML page's folder, and use the "< img>" tag <br>
		with "src = ___.jpg" to add the specified file. Height and width can also be edited, but this may distort the image. In the same img tag, set <br>
		height/width equal to a specified number, in quotes.</p>
	
	<h2><a name = "tip">Tool Tips</a></h2>
	<p> To further explain links within an HTML document, tool tips are little pop-ups that show when hovering the mouse over a link or picture. <br>
		To add a tool tip, simply type "title = " to the text of your choice, within the first anchor of a link.
